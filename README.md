## Todo_List

This application is used to make a to-do list to be able to track and visually what you may need to do. You can select a priority ranging from low to urgent as well as if it is a personal or business tasker. Once created it is easily identifiable as it is colored coded based on priority and category. It is sorted by priority first and then by time it was created. You are allowed to edit the task after being created. Your task and name are saved via local storage so the task will persist through refresh allowing you to come back and update your to do list whenever something is completed and remove it. This is my first time using Vue.
